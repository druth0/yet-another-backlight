Yet Another Backlight is just another simple backlight control tool.

It is capable of managing both keyboard and LCD backlights.

yabl i (increases LCD backlight)
yabl d (decreases LCD backlight)
yabl ik (increases keyboard backlight)
yabl dk (decreases keyboard backlight)
yabl p (prints the percentage of maximum that is currently set for the LCD backlight)
yabl pk (prints the percentage of maximum that is currently set for the keyboard backlight)

In order to use yabl with your hardware, you'll need to manually modify config.h to point to the correct /sys/class interfaces to modify.  You'll also have to install a udev rule that grants access to those files (an example is included in 90-lights.rule).
